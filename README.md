# M21-deep_learning

## Background
The nonprofit foundation Alphabet Soup will use a tool that helps it select the applicants for funding with the best chance of success in their ventures. Machine learning and neural networks were used to create a binary classifier that can predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

## Files
There is a file named Starter_CodeM21. That is the original file where the attempt 0 was made. 
The next file is named Attempts_Starter_CodeM21, where attempts 1 through 4 were made and in which the last attempt was saved. 

## Results
Three attempts were made in order to reach a minimum of 75% accuracy. 

### 1st Attempt:
Increased the nodes from 80 to 100 and from 30 to 50. This only helped increase the accuracy from 72.14% to 72.58%

### 2nd Attempt:
Increased the epochs from 100 to 150 and he accuracy actually decreased from 72.14% to 72.08%

### 3rd Attempt:
Added a 3rd layer with 20 nodes and the accuracy increased from 72.14% to 72.58%

### 4th Attempt:
Increased the cut off values for classification and for application types

## Conclusion
Based on the data set given for the analysis, it was not possible to achieve a model accuracy of 75% or higher. There were many attmpts made. From these, the original version and the 1st attempt were the ones that achieved the closest objective accuracy with a 72.58%
